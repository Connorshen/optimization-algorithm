% Demo of the spatial Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR) using query points 
% of arbitrary dimensions. This software loads a 4D dataset, trains a 
% Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and uses query points of 2 dimensions to 
% retrieve a generalized version of the data for the remaining 2 dimensions, 
% with associated constraints, through Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR).
% Each datapoint has 4 dimensions, consisting of 2x2 spatial values 
% (e.g. drawing on a 2D Cartesian plane simultaneously with right and left 
% hand). A new sequence of 2D spatial values (i.e. data for left hand) is 
% loaded and used as query points to retrieve a sequence of expected 
% spatial distributiuon for the remaining dimensions (i.e. data for right 
% hand), through Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR).
